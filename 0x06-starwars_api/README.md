# 0x06. Star Wars API
This directory contains a JavaScript source code file on consuming APIs. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* [Star Wars API](https://swapi-api.alx-tools.com/)

## How to run
All scripts have been marked as executables and can therefore be run using the syntax:

`./script`

Arguments can be passed to the script (in situations where the script accepts an argument(s)) with this syntax:

`./script argument_1 argument_2 ...`
